# Pokle - The Pokémon Search
Pokle is a search engine for all your favourite Pokémon (actually starters gen 1 to 3)

In order to use PokèSearch you will need to: 
- Clone this repository locally
- Move to the directory lap1codechallenge
- Install all dependencies with `npm i`
- Run the server with `npm run start`
    - The server will start in port 3000 by default
- Now you can open the search page! You can either: 
    - Move into the client folder and open a live server from index.html
    - You can directly right-click index.html and choose to open it with your favourite web browser!


## For experts
- If you want to add pokemon locally make sure to run `npm run dev` for your API to refresh automatically
- If you want to help us creating a test suite make sure to install the dev dependencies as the environment was already created!

## Future improvements 
- Testing suite
